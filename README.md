# SearchFragmentTest
Try to use Fragment instead of Activity for Search results

Following the example here:
http://www.materialdoc.com/search-filter/

I wanted to implement a search in an existing app. 
The app used fragment swapping (i.e. .replace()) to change displays and I wanted to stay with this model, displaying in a fragment,
instead of starting another activity. This code shows how I did that.
